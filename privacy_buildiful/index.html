<p><br /></p>
<p>By Law or to Protect Rights</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Third-Party Service Providers</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Marketing Communications</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With your consent, or with an opportunity for you to withdraw consent, we may share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Interactions with Other Users</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you interact with other users of the Application, those users may see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity, including sending invitations to other users, chatting with other users, liking posts, following blogs.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Online Postings</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When you post comments, contributions or other content to the Applications, your posts may be viewed by all users and may be publicly distributed outside the Application in perpetuity</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Third-Party Advertisers</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Application. These companies may use information about your visits to the Application and other websites that are contained in web cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Affiliates</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services or promotions.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Offer Wall</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Application may display a third-party-hosted “offer wall.” Such an offer wall allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in the Application and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will leave the Application. A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>If you connect to the Application through a social network, your contacts on the social network will see your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Sale or Bankruptcy</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Cookies and Web Beacons</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the Application to help customize the Application and improve your experience. When you access the Application, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the Application. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Internet-Based Advertising</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the Application, implement email marketing campaigns, and manage other interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use cookies or similar tracking technology to help manage and optimize your online experience with us. For more information about opting-out of interest-based ads, visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Website Analytics</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We may also partner with selected third-party vendors, such as [List any third-party analytics that your mobile app uses (eg. Google Analytics)] to allow tracking technologies and remarketing services on the Application through the use of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track users’ use of the Application, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity. By accessing the Application, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or settings.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Application.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us via email.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile applications] include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Account Information</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by contacting us via email.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Emails and Communications</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from us, you may opt-out by:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Noting your preferences at the time you register your account with the Application</li>
  <li>Contacting us via email</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails, or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Application, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Application. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.
